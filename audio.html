    <pre><h4>
        [Chorus]  
        Can't you ever be nice?  
        You don't have to think twice  
        In the moment each time that I run away  
        In the end, it's your fault  
        Really gave you my all  
        You don't have to be a problem toward me anyway  
        
        [Verse1]  
        There's much more to life than going out  
        Spend Saturday night dead on the ground (Passed out)  
        I highly doubt your father's even proud  
        Just another whore following the crowd  
        Broken glass, the bottle's enticing  
        She told me her sign is a Pisces (What?)  
        Do I look like someone who even cares? (No, God)  
        You and I would never pair  
        
        [Verse2]  
        Already off on the wrong path  
        You're such an idiot, hope you know that  
        I used to find you cute but now you're trash  
        You can change but nah, you can't change your past  
        Past  
        
        [Verse3]  
        Text me, on your end, it's open  
        But you don't know it, you don't know I ghosted  
        For once, take accountability  
        Always excuses, please  
        You are disgust to me  
        There's much more to life than blacking out  
        Spend almost every weekend on the ground  
        I smell the alcohol stench in your mouth  
        There ain't a single thing to be proud of  
        
        [Chorus]  
        Can't you ever be nice?  
        You don't have to think twice  
        In the moment each time that I run away (You are disgust to me—)  
        In the end, it's your fault  
        Really gave you my all  
        You-you don't have to be a problem toward me anyway (You-you—)  
        
        [Verse 4]  
        Run away, run away, run away  
        Run away, get away from me  
        Disgust to

    <pre><h4>
        Hello?
        Starin' at the random number but my
        Mind is at a blank
        Lookin' at my computer so I ask
        "Who is this?"
        It was my lover how could I forget?
        You're light in thunder
        I'll hurt you twice again
        Staring at the late phone call
        Whoops did I miss that on purpose?
        Yeah that was intentional and
        All this distortion
        Girl I never wanted this for you
        To go off to college
        And honestly I hated it so
        I'd never have a chance

        She say that she forget
        Everything we ever had baby that is horrible
        I think she got some problems so
        You need to worry 'bout yourself
        And there's no denying that you
        Need a lil' help
        I already played the part so
        Go find someone else
        I know that she hates it
        How I been so far cropped
        Out in the distance?
        I need to stay away from you
        No, It's not an accident
        I've focused avoiding you this
        Whole time on purpose i'm sorry, not really
        At least I didn't forget

        It's not good for you, that
        That has never bothered you before you know
        I walk through this park every day i've
        Never noticed there's a pond here
        Can you believe that? Every day for years
        And then today, bam
        Like it came out of nowhere
        I tried my best baby but
        This is never gonna happen
        I'm not the one to show love
        Should've known that was a problem
        I picked these flowers for you
        I know you probably tossed 'em
        Now i just be resting
        From girls and everybody
        She don't really love me
        She just like the attention
        How am I this stupid? OMG I'm gonna lose it
        Take in all this caffeine
        I still have no energy
        Drinking all this coffee, still got no energy

        She say that she forget
        Everything we ever had baby that is horrible
        I think she got some problems so
        You need to worry 'bout yourself
        And there's no denying that you
        Need a lil' help

    <pre><h4>  
        At night, I wanna end it all
        In bed as tears begin to fall
        I had to let it out
        Water seeps through my pillow
        
        Why won't you let me be?
        Is it revenge you seek?
        Too bad I cared for you
        More than you could ever care for me
        
        Right now, my only focus is on you
        But if I die, I promise that I will warn you
        But I cannot guarantee if I'll make it or not
        So I'll cherish every moment with you
        
        Stay here, I gotta go, I'll be right back
        I head to war when voices causing this impact
        But I cannot guarantee I'll make it out alive
        So I'll try my best to stay intact
        
        Oh, we out here alone with no one there by my side
        I keep on hearing these screams and hearing people cry
        But I don't know if it's real, don't know if it's a sign
        I just know that I'm frightened and horrified
        
        Say, "Where is log?" I don't know where they went
        I vanish into thin air and wait until I'm in
        Love for who I am and love for within
        You took that away, now there's a shredder on my skin
        
        If I were you, I would hide
        'Cause you don't know what you caused
        You put on quite a show
        Let's give a round of applause
        
        So are you done hurting me?
        And are you done with my head?
        Keep using it like a toy
        You must forgot I'm human
        
        Don't wait for me now, I don't know how long I'll be
        I'm too busy in the ground eating dirt you threw at me
        Oh, you had your chance to let me go so I could breathe
        Now you're the one who's eating dust that I'm collecting on my feet
        
        So, how does it feel now that the roles finally swapped?
        I've been living too long, feeling disgust inside this swamp
        People love to talk but never wanna say a thing
        When I be standing right there, come on, and say it to my face
        
        Don't piss on my back and say it's raining from outside
        I don't need no skin and bones for me to conjure every lie
        I know I forgave, but honestly, I change my mind
        'Cause I could not forgive a person who has stabbed me many times
        
        Say, "Where is Log?" I don't know where I have been
        I just stay as far as possible and locking every hinge
        Love for who I am and love for what I hold within
        Thanks for ruining what I had, this is where I shred my skin
        
        Don't look at me now, I feel so guilty in my chest
        Reflecting off the mirror is just a boy 'bout to collapse
        I said I wanted peace, instead I got a giant war
        And now I feel it slipping through, as if this chapter's gonna end
        
        Better start the next one, bringing in new characters
        Maybe they'll respect me and everything will register
        'Cause I don't need nobody who just screws behind my back
        So, tell me, was it worth it throwing everything we had?
